I created a local repo and pushed it to my github account,
below are the commands I input into bash:


sdn52@SKYELAPTOP MINGW64 ~/Desktop/basic_repo
$ git init

sdn52@SKYELAPTOP MINGW64 ~/Desktop/basic_repo (master)
$ git commit

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
